# Tiny Chaos Framework

Project aims to create a lightweight and simple way to run Chaos Engineering tests

Wanted an interesting little project to improve python coding skills. Utilized Claude to help build this and critique my coding styles     
All told, this seems fine. Definitely feel the "AI-ness" of the code (if that makes sense)
